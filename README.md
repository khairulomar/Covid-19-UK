# Analysis of Covid-19 in the UK
<b>Updated as of 22 Feb 2021</b>

### Objective
Since the onset of the pandemic, multiple public and private organizations in the UK have published various methods and formats of data analysis to track the spread and severity of Covid-19 using government figures released via an <b><a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/">API</a></b>, for which this repository is based on. Despite the multitude of data visualisations that are published daily by the government and media outlets, <b>I have yet to come across several formats that I believe would be even more useful in understanding the latest situation and trend. My analysis in this repository aims to showcase these new visualization ideas</b>.
<p>

For details on Python codes used to derive these visualizations, refer to the <b><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/khairulomar/Covid-19-UK/blob/main/uk-covid.ipynb?flush_cache=true">Jupyter notebook</a></b>.

In contrast, this is how the situation looked like on 9 Jan 2021 when the total UK daily cases reached its peak at 60,000. London, Liverpool and Essex all went off the charts with a 7-day incidence rate exceeding 1000 cases per 100k population. Regions in the south were hardest hit first before it spread further north; and as we would later observed, Midlands would be the last area to recover from the worst of the second wave.
